# Running Python Code with OpenAI and Tkinter

Here are the instructions to help you get started with the Python chatbot using OpenAI and Tkinter. You can open and run this code using a Python environment on your local machine, especially if you've installed the 'openai' and 'tkinter' libraries.

Follow these steps:

## 1. Install the Requirements
Make sure Python is installed on your machine. Then, install the 'openai' library if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install openai
```

## 2. Install Tkinter
Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python on most systems. If not, install it by running:

```bash
pip install tk
```

## 3. Create a New Python File
Open a text editor or IDE like Visual Studio Code or PyCharm, and create a new file (e.g., `chatbot.py`).

## 4. Add Your Code
Copy and paste the chatbot code into the `chatbot.py` file you just created.

## 5. Run the Code
After saving the file, you can run it through the command prompt or terminal by executing:

```bash
python chatbot.py
```

## 6. Launch the Chatbot GUI
A graphical user interface (GUI) window will appear where you can type messages and interact with the AI.
