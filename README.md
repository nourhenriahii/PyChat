# Chatbot GUI with OpenAI

This is a simple chatbot application built with Python using **Tkinter** for the graphical user interface (GUI) and **OpenAI API** for natural language conversation. It allows users to interact with a chatbot directly through a desktop interface.

## Features
- **GUI-based Chatbot**: Built using Tkinter for an interactive and user-friendly interface.
- **Powered by OpenAI**: Uses the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model to provide dynamic and intelligent responses to user queries.
- **Text-based Communication**: Send and receive messages through the GUI.

## Requirements

Before running the application, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python)
- OpenAI Python library

### Installing Dependencies
To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
 pip install openai

Here are the instructions to help you get started with the Python chatbot using OpenAI and Tkinter. You can open and run this code using a Python environment on your local machine, especially if you've installed the 'openai' and 'tkinter' libraries.

Follow these steps:

## 1. Install the Requirements
Make sure Python is installed on your machine. Then, install the 'openai' library if you haven't already:

bash
pip install openai


## 2. Install Tkinter
Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python on most systems. If not, install it by running:

bash
pip install tk


## 3. Create a New Python File
Open a text editor or IDE like Visual Studio Code or PyCharm, and create a new file (e.g., chatbot.py).

## 4. Add Your Code
Copy and paste the chatbot code into the chatbot.py file you just created.

## 5. Run the Code
After saving the file, you can run it through the command prompt or terminal by executing:

bash
python chatbot.py


## 6. Launch the Chatbot GUI
A graphical user interface (GUI) window will appear where you can type messages and interact with the AI.
